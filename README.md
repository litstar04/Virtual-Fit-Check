# Virtual Fit Check 👚📐

**A smart fit recommendation system for online fashion shoppers.**

This project was developed as part of my B.Tech minor project to address a key issue in e-commerce: clothing returns due to poor fit. *Virtual Fit Check* uses computer vision and machine learning to recommend better-fitting clothes based on a user’s body measurements.

Users can either manually input their measurements or upload an image — the system then processes the data, predicts key body ratios using tools like MediaPipe and OpenCV, and recommends suitable clothing using clustering and similarity algorithms.

### 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python, Flask (Backend)
- React.js (Frontend)
- TensorFlow, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- OpenCV & MediaPipe (Image-based measurement)
- K-means clustering, Euclidean & Cosine similarity

### 📈 Impact

The system reduces guesswork in online fashion shopping and aims to minimize return rates — offering a smoother experience for both users and retailers.
